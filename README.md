# 🎧 Multi-Agent Customer Support System (CrewAI + Gradio)

This project is an **AI-powered customer support system** that leverages **CrewAI multi-agent orchestration** to process customer tickets, generate empathetic replies, and assist support teams with internal notes.

It provides an interactive **Gradio UI** for:

- 📂 Bulk uploading tickets from CSV  
- 🧠 Converting tickets into a Knowledge Base (KB)  
- 📌 Creating single tickets dynamically  
- ⚡ Processing tickets with AI agents (customer replies + internal notes)  
- 💡 Performing system health checks
